<h2 class="h2-chapa"><a id="page_132" class="signup-nounder"></a><span class="red1">1</span> Embrace Reality and Deal with It</h2>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_133" class="calibre1"></a><span class="stickup">T</span>here is nothing more important than understanding how reality works and how to deal with it. The state of mind you bring to this process makes all the difference. I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me avoid the same sort of problem in the future. Collecting these gems continually improves my decision making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play in which the game gets harder and the stakes become ever greater.</p>
<p class="indent">All sorts of emotions come to me while I am playing and those emotions can either help me or hurt me. If I can reconcile my emotions with my logic and only act when they are aligned, I make better decisions.</p>
<p class="indent">Learning how reality works, visualizing the things I want to create, and then building them out is incredibly exciting to me. Stretching for big goals puts me in the position of failing and needing to learn and come up with new inventions in order to move forward. I find it exhilarating being caught up in the feedback loop of rapid learning—just as a surfer loves riding a wave, even though it sometimes leads to crashes. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still scared of the crashes and I still find them <a id="page_134" class="calibre1"></a>painful. But I keep that pain in perspective, knowing that I will get through these setbacks and that most of my learning will come from reflecting on them.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch00fn14" href="part0023.xhtml#ch00-fn14" class="signup-nounder">14</a></sup> Just as long-distance runners push through pain to experience the pleasure of “runner’s high,” I have largely gotten past the pain of my mistake making and instead enjoy the pleasure that comes with learning from it. I believe that with practice you can change your habits and experience the same “mistake learner’s high.”</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="p2c1lev1sec1" class="signup-nounder"></a><span class="red1">1.1</span> Be a hyperrealist.</h3>
<p class="noindent">Understanding, accepting, and working with reality is both practical and beautiful. I have become so much of a hyperrealist that I’ve learned to appreciate the beauty of all realities, even harsh ones, and have come to despise impractical idealism.</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t get me wrong: I believe in making dreams happen. To me, there’s nothing better in life than doing that. The pursuit of dreams is what gives life its flavor. My point is that people who create great things aren’t idle dreamers: They are totally grounded in reality. Being hyperrealistic will help you choose your dreams wisely and then achieve them. I have found the following to be almost always true:</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c1lev2se1" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">a.</span> Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life.</span> People who achieve success and drive progress deeply understand the cause-effect relationships that govern reality and have principles for using them to get what they want. The converse is also true: Idealists who are not well grounded in reality create problems, not progress.</p>
<p class="indent">What does a successful life look like? We all have our own deep-seated needs, so we each have to decide for ourselves what success is. I don’t care whether you want to be a master of the universe, a couch potato, or anything else—I really don’t. Some people want to change the world and others want to operate in simple harmony with it and <a id="page_135" class="calibre1"></a>savor life. Neither is better. Each of us needs to decide what we value most and choose the paths we take to achieve it.</p>
<p class="indent">Take a moment to reflect on where you are on the following scale, which illustrates an overly simplified choice you should think about. Where would you put yourself on it?</p>
<div class="inline_group">
<img class="landscape_" src="../Images/image00357.jpeg" alt="images"/>
</div>
<p class="indent">The question isn’t just how much of each to go after, but how hard to work to get as much as possible. I wanted crazy amounts of each, was thrilled to work hard to get as much of them as possible, and found that they could largely be one and the same and mutually reinforcing. Over time I learned that getting more out of life wasn’t just a matter of working harder at it. It was much more a matter of working effectively, because working effectively could increase my capacity by hundreds of times. I don’t care what you want or how hard you want to work for it. That’s for you to decide. I’m just trying to pass along to you what has helped me get the most out of each hour of time and each unit of effort.</p>
<p class="indent">Most importantly, I’ve learned that there is no escaping the fact that:</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="p2c1lev1sec2" class="signup-nounder"></a><span class="red1">1.2</span> Truth—or, more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality—is the essential foundation for any good outcome.</h3>
<p class="noindent">Most people fight seeing what’s true when it’s not what they want it to be. That’s bad, because it is more important to understand and deal with the bad stuff since the good stuff will take care of itself.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_136" class="calibre1"></a>Do you agree with that? If not, you are unlikely to benefit from what follows. If you do agree, let’s build on it.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="p2c1lev1sec3" class="signup-nounder"></a><span class="red1">1.3</span> Be radically open-minded and radically transparent.</h3>
<p class="noindent">None of us is born knowing what is true; we either have to discover what’s true for ourselves or believe and follow others. The key is to know which path will yield better results.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch00fn15" href="part0023.xhtml#ch00-fn15" class="signup-nounder">15</a></sup> I believe that:</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c1lev2se2" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">a.</span> Radical open-mindedness and radical transparency are invaluable for rapid learning and effective change.</span> Learning is the product of a continuous real-time feedback loop in which we make decisions, see their outcomes, and improve our understanding of reality as a result. Being radically open-minded enhances the efficiency of those feedback loops, because it makes what you are doing, and why, so clear to yourself and others that there can’t be any misunderstandings. The more open-minded you are, the less likely you are to deceive yourself—and the more likely it is that others will give you honest feedback. If they are “believable” people (and it’s very important to know who is “believable”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch00fn16" href="part0023.xhtml#ch00-fn16" class="signup-nounder">16</a></sup>), you will learn a lot from them.</p>
<p class="indent">Being radically transparent and radically open-minded accelerates this learning process. It can also be difficult because being radically transparent rather than more guarded exposes one to criticism. It’s <a id="page_137" class="calibre1"></a>natural to fear that. Yet if you don’t put yourself out there with your radical transparency, you won’t learn.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c1lev2se3" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">b.</span> Don’t let fears of what others think of you stand in your way.</span> You must be willing to do things in the unique ways you think are best—and to open-mindedly reflect on the feedback that comes inevitably as a result of being that way.</p>
<p class="indent">Learning to be radically transparent is like learning to speak in public: While it’s initially awkward, the more you do it, the more comfortable you will be with it. This has been true for me. For example, I still instinctively find being as radically transparent in the ways that I am in this book uncomfortable because I am exposing personal material to the public that will attract attention and criticism. Yet I am doing it because I’ve learned that it’s best, and I wouldn’t feel good about myself if I let my fears stand in the way. In other words, I have experienced the positive effects of radical transparency for so long that it’s now uncomfortable for me not to be that way.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides giving me the freedom to be me, it has allowed me to understand others and for them to understand me, which is much more efficient and much more enjoyable than not having this understanding. Imagine how many fewer misunderstandings we would have and how much more efficient the world would be—and how much closer we all would be to knowing what’s true—if instead of hiding what they think, people shared it openly. I’m not talking about everyone’s very personal inner secrets; I’m talking about people’s opinions of each other and of how the world works. As you’ll see, I’ve learned firsthand how powerful this kind of radical truth and transparency is in improving my decision making and my relationships. So whenever I’m faced with the choice, my instinct is to be transparent. I practice it as a discipline and I recommend you do the same.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c1lev2se4" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">c.</span> Embracing radical truth and radical transparency will bring more meaningful work and more meaningful relationships.</span> My experience, based on watching thousands of people try this approach, is that with <a id="page_138" class="calibre1"></a>practice the vast majority find it so rewarding and pleasurable that they have a hard time operating any other way.</p>
<p class="indent">This takes practice and changing one’s habits. I have found that it typically takes about eighteen months, which is how long it takes to change most habits.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="p2c1lev1sec4" class="signup-nounder"></a><span class="red1">1.4</span> Look to nature to learn how reality works.</h3>
<p class="noindent">All the laws of reality were given to us by nature. Man didn’t create these laws, but by understanding them we can use them to foster our own evolution and achieve our goals. For example, our ability to fly or to send cell phone signals around the world came from understanding and applying the existing rules of reality—the physical laws or principles that govern the natural world.</p>
<p class="indent">While I spend most of my time studying the realities that affect me most directly—those that drive economies, the markets, and the people I deal with—I also spend time in nature and can’t help reflecting on how it works by observing, reading, and speaking with some of the greatest specialists on the subject. I’ve found it both interesting and valuable to observe which laws we humans have in common with the rest of nature and which differentiate us. Doing that has had a big impact on my approach to life.</p>
<p class="indent">First of all, I see how cool it is that the brain’s evolution gave us the ability to reflect on how reality works in this way. Man’s most distinctive quality is our singular ability to look down on reality from a higher perspective and synthesize an understanding of it. While other species operate by following their instincts, man alone can go above himself and look at himself within his circumstances and within time (including before and after his existence). For example, we can ponder the ways that nature’s flying machines, swimming machines, and billions of other machines, from the microscopic to the cosmic, interact with one another to make up a working whole that evolves through time. This is because the evolution of the brain gave man a much more <a id="page_139" class="calibre1"></a>developed neocortex, which gives us the power to think abstractly and logically.</p>
<p class="indent">While our higher-level thinking makes us unique among species, it can also make us uniquely confused. Other species have much simpler and more straightforward lives, without any of man’s wrestling with what’s good and what’s bad. In contrast with animals, most people struggle to reconcile their emotions and their instincts (which come from the animal parts of their brains) with their reasoning (which comes from parts of the brain more developed in humans). This struggle causes people to confuse what they want to be true with what actually is true. Let’s look at this dilemma to try to understand how reality works.</p>
<p class="indentb">When trying to understand anything—economies, markets, the weather, whatever—one can approach the subject with two perspectives:</p>
<p class="num"><span class="txbf2">1. Top down:</span> By trying to find the one code/law that drives them all. For example, in the case of markets, one could study universal laws like supply and demand that affect all economies and markets. In the case of species, one could focus on learning how the genetic code (DNA) works for all species.</p>
<p class="num"><span class="txbf2">2. Bottom up:</span> By studying each specific case and the codes/laws that are true for them, for example, the codes or laws particular to the market for wheat or the DNA sequences that make ducks different from other species.</p>
<p class="indenta">Seeing things from the top down is the best way to understand ourselves and the laws of reality within the context of overarching universal laws. That’s not to say it’s not worth having a bottom-up perspective. In fact, to understand the world accurately you need both. By taking a bottom-up perspective that looks at each individual case, we can see how it lines up with our theories about the laws that we expect to govern it. When they line up, we’re good.</p>
<p class="indent">By looking at nature from the top down, we can see that much of what we call human nature is really animal nature. That’s because the human brain is programmed with millions of years of genetic learning <a id="page_140" class="calibre1"></a>that we share with other species. Because we share common roots and common laws, we and other animals have similar attributes and constraints. For example, the male/female sexual reproduction process, using two eyes to provide depth perception, and many other systems are shared by many species in the animal kingdom. Similarly, our brains have some “animal” parts that are much older in evolutionary terms than humanity is. These laws that we have in common are the most overarching ones. They wouldn’t be apparent to us if we just looked at ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">If you just looked at one species—ducks, for example—to try to understand the universal laws, you’d fail. Similarly, if you just looked at mankind to understand the universal laws, you’d fail. Man is just one of ten million species and just one of the billions of manifestations of the forces that bring together and take apart atoms through time. Yet most people are like ants focused only on themselves and their own anthill; they believe the universe revolves around people and don’t pay attention to the universal laws that are true for all species.</p>
<p class="indent">To try to figure out the universal laws of reality and principles for dealing with it, I’ve found it helpful to try to look at things from nature’s perspective. While mankind is very intelligent in relation to other species, we have the intelligence of moss growing on a rock compared to nature as a whole. We are incapable of designing and building a mosquito, let alone all the species and most of the other things in the universe. So I start from the premise that nature is smarter than I am and try to let nature teach me how reality works.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c1lev2se5" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">a.</span> Don’t get hung up on your views of how things “should” be because you will miss out on learning how they really are.</span> It’s important not to let our biases stand in the way of our objectivity. To get good results, we need to be analytical rather than emotional.</p>
<p class="indent">Whenever I observe something in nature that I (or mankind) think is wrong, I assume that <span class="txit">I’m</span> wrong and try to figure out why what nature is doing makes sense. That has taught me a lot. It has changed my thinking about 1) what’s good and what’s bad, 2) what my purpose in life is, and 3) <a id="page_141" class="calibre1"></a>what I should do when faced with my most important choices. To help explain why, I will give you a simple example.</p>
<p class="indent">When I went to Africa a number of years ago, I saw a pack of hyenas take down a young wildebeest. My reaction was visceral. I felt empathy for the wildebeest and thought that what I had witnessed was horrible. But was that because it <span class="txit">was</span> horrible or was it because I am biased to believe it’s horrible when it is actually wonderful? That got me thinking. Would the world be a better or worse place if what I’d seen hadn’t occurred? That perspective drove me to consider the second- and third-order consequences so that I could see that the world would be worse. I now realize that nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual, but most people judge good and bad based only on how it affects them. What I had seen was the process of nature at work, which is much more effective at furthering the improvement of the whole than any process man has ever invented.</p>
<p class="indent">Most people call something bad if it is bad for them or bad for those they empathize with, ignoring the greater good. This tendency extends to groups: One religion will consider its beliefs good and another religion’s beliefs bad to such an extent that their members might kill each other in the mutual conviction that each is doing what’s right. Typically, people’s conflicting beliefs or conflicting interests make them unable to see things through another’s eyes. That’s not good and it doesn’t make sense. While I could understand people liking something that helps them and disliking things that hurt them, it doesn’t make sense to call something good or bad in an absolute sense based only on how it affects individuals. To do so would presume that what the individual wants is more important than the good of the whole. To me, nature seems to define good as what’s good for the whole and optimizes for it, which is preferable. So I have come to believe that as a general rule:</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c1lev2se6" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">b.</span> To be “good” something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and contribute to the evolution of the whole; that is what is most rewarded.</span> For example, if you come up with something the world values, you almost can’t help but be rewarded. Conversely, <a id="page_142" class="calibre1"></a>reality tends to penalize those people, species, and things that don’t work well and detract from evolution.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch00fn17" href="part0023.xhtml#ch00-fn17" class="signup-nounder">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindentt">In looking at what is true for everything, I have come to believe that:</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c1lev2se7" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">c.</span> Evolution is the single greatest force in the universe; it is the only thing that is permanent and it drives everything.</span><sup class="sup"><a id="ch00fn18" href="part0023.xhtml#ch00-fn18" class="signup-nounder">18</a></sup> Everything from the smallest subatomic particle to the entire galaxy is evolving. While everything apparently dies or disappears in time, the truth is that it all just gets reconfigured in evolving forms. Remember that energy can’t be destroyed—it can only be reconfigured. So the same stuff is continuously falling apart and coalescing in different forms. The force behind that is evolution.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, the primary purpose of every living thing is to act as a vessel for the DNA that evolves life through time. The DNA that exists within each individual came from an eternity ago and will continue to live long after its individual carriers pass away, in increasingly evolved forms.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch00fn19" href="part0023.xhtml#ch00-fn19" class="signup-nounder">19</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">As I thought about evolution, I realized that it exists in other forms than life and is carried out through other transmission mechanisms than DNA. Technologies, languages, and everything else evolves. Knowledge, for example, is like DNA in that it is passed from generation to generation and evolves; its impact on people over many generations can be as great or greater than that of the genetic code.</p>
<p class="indent">Evolution is good because it is the process of adaptation that generally moves things toward improvement. All things such as products, organizations, and human capabilities evolve through time in a similar way. It is simply the process by which things either adapt and improve or die. To me this evolutionary process looks like what you see on the right:</p>
<div class="inline_group">
<a id="page_143" class="calibre1"></a><img class="landscape_" src="../Images/image00358.jpeg" alt="images"/>
</div>
<div class="inline_group">
<a id="page_144" class="calibre1"></a><img class="portrait_" src="../Images/image00359.jpeg" alt="images"/>
</div>
<div class="inline_group">
<img class="portrait_" src="../Images/image00360.jpeg" alt="images"/>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_145" class="calibre1"></a>Evolution consists of adaptations/inventions that provide spurts of benefits that decline in value. That painful decline leads either to new adaptations and new inventions that bring new products, organizations, and human capabilities to new and higher levels of development (as shown in the top diagram on the facing page); or decline and death, which looks like the diagram at bottom left.</p>
<p class="indent">Think of any product, organization, or person you know and you will see that this is true. The world is littered with once-great things that deteriorated and failed; only a rare few have kept reinventing themselves to go on to new heights of greatness. All machines eventually break down, decompose, and have their parts recycled to create new machines. That includes us. Sometimes this makes us sad because we’ve become attached to our machines, but if you look at it from the higher level, it’s really beautiful to observe how the machine of evolution works.</p>
<p class="indent">From this perspective, we can see that perfection doesn’t exist; it is a goal that fuels a never-ending process of adaptation. If nature, or anything, were perfect it wouldn’t be evolving. Organisms, organizations, and individual people are always highly imperfect but capable of improving. So rather than getting stuck hiding our mistakes and pretending we’re perfect, it makes sense to find our imperfections and deal with them. You will either learn valuable lessons from your mistakes and press on, better equipped to succeed—or you won’t and you will fail.</p>
<p class="indent">As the saying goes:</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c1lev2se8" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">d.</span> Evolve or die.</span> This evolutionary cycle is not just for people but for countries, companies, economies—for everything. And it is naturally self-correcting as a whole, though not necessarily for its parts. For example, if there is too much supply and waste in a market, prices will go down, companies will go out of business, and capacity will be reduced until the supply falls in line with the demand, at which time the cycle will start to move in the opposite direction. Similarly, if an economy turns bad enough, those responsible for running it will make the political and policy changes that are needed—or they will not survive, making room for their replacements to come along. These cycles are continuous and play out in logical ways—and they tend to be self-reinforcing.</p>
