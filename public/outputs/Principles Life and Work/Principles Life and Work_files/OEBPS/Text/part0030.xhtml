<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_235" class="calibre1"></a><span class="stickup">A</span>s a professional decision maker, I have spent my life studying how to make decisions effectively and have constantly looked for rules and systems that will improve my odds of being right and ending up with more of whatever it is that I am after.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the most important things I’ve come to understand is that most of the processes that go into everyday decision making are subconscious and more complex than is widely understood. For example, think about how you choose and maintain a safe distance behind the car in front of you when you are driving. Now describe the process in enough detail that someone who has never driven a car before can do it as well as you can, or so that it can be programmed into the computer that controls an autonomous car. I bet you can’t.</p>
<p class="indent">Now think about the challenge of making all of your decisions well, in a systematic, repeatable way, and then being able to describe the processes so clearly and precisely that anyone else can make the same quality decisions under the same circumstances. That is what I aspire to do and have found to be invaluable, even when highly imperfect.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_236" class="calibre1"></a>While there is no one best way to make decisions, there are some universal rules for good decision making. They start with:</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="p2c5lev1sec1" class="signup-nounder"></a><span class="red1">5.1</span> Recognize that 1) the biggest threat to good decision making is harmful emotions, and 2) decision making is a two-step process (first learning and then deciding).</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="txbf1">Learning</span> must come before deciding. As explained in Chapter One, your brain stores different types of learning in your subconscious, your rote memory bank, and your habits. But no matter how you acquire your knowledge or where you store it, what’s most important is that what you know paints a true and rich picture of the realities that will affect your decision. That’s why it always pays to be radically open-minded and seek out believable others as you do your learning. Many people have emotional trouble doing this and block the learning that could help them make better decisions. Remind yourself that it’s never harmful to at least hear an opposing point of view.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="txbf1">Deciding</span> is the process of choosing which knowledge should be drawn upon—both the facts of this particular “what is” and your broader understanding of the cause-effect machinery that underlies it—and then weighing them to determine a course of action, the “what to do about it.” This involves playing different scenarios through time to visualize how to get an outcome consistent with what you want. To do this well, you need to weigh first-order consequences against second- and third-order consequences, and base your decisions not just on near-term results but on results over time.</p>
<p class="indent">Failing to consider second- and third-order consequences is the cause of a lot of painfully bad decisions, and it is especially deadly when the first inferior option confirms your own biases. Never seize <a id="page_237" class="calibre1"></a>on the first available option, no matter how good it seems, before you’ve asked questions and explored. To prevent myself from falling into this trap, I used to literally ask myself questions: Am I learning? Have I learned enough yet that it’s time for deciding? After a while, you will just naturally and open-mindedly gather all the relevant info, but in doing so you will have avoided the first pitfall of bad decision making, which is to subconsciously make the decision first and then cherry-pick the data that supports it.</p>
<p class="indent">But how does one learn well?</p>
<h3 class="h"><span class="txbf">LEARNING WELL</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">For me, getting an accurate picture of reality ultimately comes down to two things: being able to synthesize accurately and knowing how to navigate levels.</p>
<p class="indent">Synthesis is the process of converting a lot of data into an accurate picture. The quality of your synthesis will determine the quality of your decision making. This is why it always pays to triangulate your views with people who you know synthesize well. This raises your chances of having a good synthesis, even if you feel like you’ve already done it yourself. No sensible person should reject a believable person’s views without great fear of being wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">To synthesize well, you must 1) synthesize the situation at hand, 2) synthesize the situation through time, and 3) navigate levels effectively.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="p2c5lev1sec2" class="signup-nounder"></a><span class="red1">5.2</span> Synthesize the situation at hand.</h3>
<p class="noindent">Every day you are faced with an infinite number of things that come at you. Let’s call them “dots.” To be effective, you need to be able to tell which dots are important and which dots are not. Some people go through life collecting all kinds of observations and opinions like pocket lint, instead of just keeping what they need. They have “detail anxiety,” worrying about unimportant things.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_238" class="calibre1"></a>Sometimes small things can be important—for example, that little rattle in your car’s engine could just be a loose piece of plastic or it could be a sign your timing belt is about to snap. The key is having the higher-level perspective to make fast and accurate judgments on what the real risks are without getting bogged down in details.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember:</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c5lev2se1" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">a.</span> One of the most important decisions you can make is who you ask questions of.</span> Make sure they’re fully informed and believable. Find out who is responsible for whatever you are seeking to understand and then ask them. Listening to uninformed people is worse than having no answers at all.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c5lev2se2" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">b.</span> Don’t believe everything you hear.</span> Opinions are a dime a dozen and nearly everyone will share theirs with you. Many will state them as if they are facts. Don’t mistake opinions for facts.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c5lev2se3" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">c.</span> Everything looks bigger up close.</span> In all aspects of life, what’s happening today seems like a much bigger deal than it will appear in retrospect. That’s why it helps to step back to gain perspective and sometimes defer a decision until some time passes.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c5lev2se4" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">d.</span> New is overvalued relative to great.</span> For example, when choosing which movie to watch or what book to read, are you drawn to proven classics or the newest big thing? In my opinion, it is smarter to choose the great over the new.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c5lev2se5" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">e.</span> Don’t oversqueeze dots.</span> A dot is just one piece of data from one moment in time; keep that in perspective as you synthesize. Just as you need to sort big from small, and what’s happening in the moment from overall patterns, you need to know how much learning you can get out of any one dot without overweighing it.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="p2c5lev1sec3" class="signup-nounder"></a><span class="red1">5.3</span> Synthesize the situation through time.</h3>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_239" class="calibre1"></a>To see how the dots connect through time you must collect, analyze, and sort different types of information, which isn’t easy. For example, let’s imagine a day in which eight outcomes occur. Some are good, some bad. Let’s illustrate this day as shown, with each type of event represented by a letter and the quality of the outcome represented by its height.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to see the day this way, you must categorize outcomes by type (signified by letters) and quality (the higher up the graph, the better), which will require synthesizing a by-and-large assessment of each. (To make the example more concrete, imagine you’re running an ice cream shop and the W’s represent sales, the X’s represent customer experience ratings, the Y’s represent press and reviews, the Z’s represent staff engagement, etc.) Keep in mind that our example is a relatively simple one: just eight occurrences over one day.</p>
<p class="indent">From the chart on the right, you can see that it was a great day for sales (because the W’s are at the top) and a bad day for customer experience (the X’s). You might conjecture why—maybe a crowd generated sales but produced long lines.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Now let’s look at what a month of workdays looks like. Confusing, eh?</p>
<p class="indent">The chart below plots just the type X dots, which you can see are improving.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_244" class="calibre1"></a>People who are good at pulling out such patterns of events are rare and essential, but as with most abilities, synthesizing through time is only partially innate; even if you’re not good at it, you can get better through practice. You’ll increase your chances of succeeding at it if you follow the next principle.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c5lev2se6" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">a.</span> Keep in mind both the rates of change and the levels of things, and the relationships between them.</span> When determining an acceptable rate of improvement for something, it is its level in relation to the rate of change that matters. I often see people lose sight of this. They say “it’s getting better” without noticing how far below the bar it is and whether the rate of change will get it above the bar in an acceptable amount of time. If someone who has been getting grades of 30s and 40s on their tests raised their scores to 50s over the course of a few months it would be accurate to say that they are getting better, but they would still be woefully inadequate. Everything important in your life needs to be on a trajectory to be above the bar and headed toward excellent at an appropriate pace. The lines in the chart on the next page show how the dots connect through time. A’s trajectory gets you above the bar in an appropriate amount of time; B’s does not. To make good decisions, you need to understand the reality of which of these two cases is happening.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c5lev2se7" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">b.</span> Be imprecise.</span> Understand the concept of “by-and-large” and use approximations. Because our educational system is hung up on precision, the art of being good at approximations is insufficiently valued. This impedes conceptual thinking. For example, when asked to multiply 38 by 12, most people do it the slow and hard way rather than simply rounding 38 up to 40, rounding 12 down to 10, and quickly determining that the answer is about 400. Look at the ice cream shop example and imagine the value of quickly seeing the approximate relationships between the dots versus taking the time to see all the edges precisely. It would be silly to spend time doing that, yet that’s exactly what most people do. “By-and-large” is the level at which you need to understand most things in order to make effective decisions. Whenever a big-picture “by-and-large” statement is made and someone replies “Not always,” my instinctual reaction is that we are probably about to dive into the weeds—i.e., into a discussion of the exceptions rather than the rule, and in the process we will lose sight of the rule. To help people at Bridgewater avoid this time waster, one of our just-out-of-college associates coined a saying I often repeat: “When you ask someone whether something is true and they tell you that it’s not totally true, it’s probably by-and-large true.”</p>

<p class="noindentt"><a id="page_246" class="calibre1"></a><a id="p2c5lev2se8" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">c.</span> Remember the 80/20 Rule and know what the key 20 percent is.</span> The 80/20 Rule states that you get 80 percent of the value out of something from 20 percent of the information or effort. (It’s also true that you’re likely to exert 80 percent of your effort getting the final 20 percent of value.) Understanding this rule saves you from getting bogged down in unnecessary detail once you’ve gotten most of the learning you need to make a good decision.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c5lev2se9" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">d.</span> Be an imperfectionist.</span> Perfectionists spend too much time on little differences at the margins at the expense of the important things. There are typically just five to ten important factors to consider when making a decision. It is important to understand these really well, though the marginal gains of studying even the important things past a certain point are limited.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="p2c5lev1sec4" class="signup-nounder"></a><span class="red1">5.4</span> Navigate levels effectively.</h3>
<p class="noindent">Reality exists at different levels and each of them gives you different but valuable perspectives. It’s important to keep all of them in mind as you synthesize and make decisions, and to know how to navigate between them.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you’re looking at your hometown on Google Maps. Zoom in close enough to see the buildings and you won’t be able to see the region surrounding your town, which can tell you important <a id="page_247" class="calibre1"></a>things. Maybe your town sits next to a body of water. Zoom in too close and you won’t be able to tell if the shoreline is along a river, a lake, or an ocean. You need to know which level is appropriate to your decision.</p>
<p class="indent">We are constantly seeing things at different levels and navigating between them, whether we know it or not, whether we do it well or not, and whether our objects are physical things, ideas, or goals. For example, you can navigate levels to move from your values to what you do to realize them on a day-to-day basis. This is what that looks like in outline:</p>
<p class="num"><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">1</span> The High-Level Big Picture:</span> I want meaningful work that’s full of learning.</p>
<p class="num1"><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">1.1</span> Subordinate Concept:</span> I want to be a doctor.</p>
<p class="bull1"><span class="red">•</span> <span class="txbf2">Sub-Point:</span> I need to go to medical school.</p>
<p class="bull2"><span class="red">•</span> <span class="txbf2">Sub-Sub Point:</span> I need to get good grades in the sciences.</p>
<p class="bull3"><span class="red">•</span> <span class="txbf2">Sub-Sub-Sub Point:</span> I need to stay home tonight and study.</p>
<p class="indenta">To observe how well you do this in your own life, pay attention to your conversations. We tend to move between levels when we talk.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c5lev2se10" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">a.</span> Use the terms “above the line” and “below the line” to establish which level a conversation is on.</span> An above-the-line conversation addresses the main points and a below-the-line conversation focuses on the sub-points. When a line of reasoning is jumbled and confusing, it’s often because the speaker has gotten caught up in below-the-line details without connecting them back to the major points. An above-the-line discourse should progress in an orderly and accurate way to its conclusion, only going below the line when it’s necessary to illustrate something about one of the major points.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="p2c5lev2se11" class="calibre1"></a><span class="txbf2"><span class="red">b.</span> Remember that decisions need to be made at the appropriate level, but they should also be consistent across levels.</span> For instance, if you want to have a healthy life, you shouldn’t have twelve sausage links and a beer every day for breakfast. In other words, you need to constantly connect and reconcile the data you’re gathering at different levels in order to draw a complete picture of what’s going on. Like synthesizing in general, some people are naturally better at this than others, but anyone can learn to do this to one degree or another. To do it well, it’s necessary to:</p>
