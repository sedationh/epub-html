<h1 class="chapter_head"><a class="hlink" id="ind665a"></a>SECRETS</h1>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps2line">E</span><span class="small1">VERY ONE OF TODAY</span>’<span class="small1">S</span> most famous and familiar ideas was once unknown and unsuspected. The mathematical relationship between a triangle’s sides, for example, was secret for millennia. <a class="hlink" id="ind623a"></a>Pythagoras had to think hard to discover it. If you wanted in on Pythagoras’s new discovery, joining his strange vegetarian cult was the best way to learn about it. Today, his geometry has become a convention—a simple truth we teach to grade schoolers. A <a class="hlink" id="ind140a"></a>conventional truth can be important—it’s essential to learn elementary mathematics, for example—but it won’t give you an edge. It’s not a secret.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember our <a class="hlink" id="ind138a"></a>contrarian question: <span class="italic">what important truth do very few people agree with you on?</span> If we already understand as much of the natural world as we ever will—if all of today’s conventional ideas are already enlightened, and if everything <a id="page94"></a>has already been done—then there are no good answers. Contrarian thinking doesn’t make any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up.</p>
<div class="titlepage"><div class="squeeze1"><img alt="" class="squeeze-epub" src="images/Thie_9780804139304_epub_020_r1.jpg"/><img alt="" class="squeeze-amzn22" src="images/Thie_9780804139304_epub_020_r1.jpg"/></div></div>
<p class="indent">Of course, there are many things we don’t yet understand, but some of those things may be impossible to figure out—mysteries rather than secrets. For example, <a class="hlink" id="ind753a"></a>string theory describes the physics of the universe in terms of vibrating one-dimensional objects called “strings.” Is string theory true? You can’t really design experiments to test it. Very few people, if any, could ever understand all its implications. But is that just because it’s difficult? Or is it an impossible mystery? The difference matters. You can achieve difficult things, but you can’t achieve the impossible.</p>
<p class="indent">Recall the business version of our contrarian question: <span class="italic">what valuable company is nobody building?</span> Every correct answer is necessarily a secret: something important and unknown, something hard to do but doable. If there are many secrets left in the world, there are probably many world-changing companies yet to be started. This chapter will help you think about secrets and how to find them.</p>
<h2 class="a_head">WHY AREN’T PEOPLE <a class="hlink" id="ind670a"></a>LOOKING FOR SECRETS?</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Most people act as if there were no secrets left to find. An extreme representative of this view is <a class="hlink" id="ind401a"></a>Ted Kaczynski, infamously known as the <a class="hlink" id="ind788a"></a>Unabomber. Kaczynski was a child prodigy who enrolled at Harvard at 16. He went on to get a PhD in math and become a professor at UC Berkeley. But you’ve only ever heard of him because of the 17-year terror <a id="page95"></a>campaign he waged with pipe bombs against professors, technologists, and businesspeople.</p>
<p class="indent">In late 1995, the authorities didn’t know who or where the Unabomber was. The biggest clue was a 35,000-word manifesto that Kaczynski had written and anonymously mailed to the press. The <a class="hlink" id="ind237a"></a>FBI asked some prominent newspapers to publish it, hoping for a break in the case. It worked: Kaczynski’s brother recognized his writing style and turned him in.</p>
<p class="indent">You might expect that writing style to have shown obvious signs of insanity, but the manifesto is eerily cogent. Kaczynski claimed that in order to be happy, every individual “needs to have <a class="hlink" id="ind300a"></a>goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.” He divided human goals into three groups:</p>
<div class="num_list">
<p class="num_item">1. Goals that can be satisfied with minimal effort;</p>
<p class="num_item">2. Goals that can be satisfied with serious effort; and</p>
<p class="num_item">3. Goals that cannot be satisfied, no matter how much effort one makes.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This is the classic trichotomy of the easy, the hard, and the impossible. Kaczynski argued that modern people are depressed because all the world’s hard problems have already been solved. What’s left to do is either easy or impossible, and pursuing those tasks is deeply unsatisfying. What you can do, even a child can do; what you can’t do, even Einstein couldn’t have done. So Kaczynski’s idea was to destroy existing institutions, get rid of all technology, and let people start over and work on hard problems anew.</p>
<p class="indent">Kaczynski’s methods were crazy, but his loss of faith in the <a id="page96"></a>technological frontier is all around us. Consider the trivial but revealing hallmarks of urban <a class="hlink" id="ind329a"></a>hipsterdom: faux vintage photography, the handlebar mustache, and vinyl record players all hark back to an earlier time when people were still optimistic about the future. If everything worth doing has already been done, you may as well feign an allergy to achievement and become a barista.</p>
<div class="titlepage" id="c08-fig1"><div class="squeeze1"><img alt="" class="squeeze-epub" src="images/Thie_9780804139304_epub_021_r1.jpg"/><img alt="" class="squeeze-amzn23" src="images/Thie_9780804139304_epub_021_r1.jpg"/></div></div>
<p class="caption_hr">Hipster or Unabomber?</p>
<p class="indent">All <a class="hlink" id="ind272a"></a>fundamentalists think this way, not just terrorists and hipsters. Religious fundamentalism, for example, allows no middle ground for hard questions: there are easy truths that children are expected to rattle off, and then there are the mysteries of God, which can’t be explained. In between—the zone of hard truths—lies heresy. In the modern religion of environmentalism, the easy truth is that we must protect the environment. Beyond that, Mother Nature knows best, <a id="page97"></a>and she cannot be questioned. <a class="hlink" id="ind270a"></a>Free marketeers worship a similar logic. The value of things is set by the market. Even a child can look up stock quotes. But whether those prices make sense is not to be second-guessed; the market knows far more than you ever could.</p>
<p class="indent">Why has so much of our society come to believe that there are no hard secrets left? It might start with geography. There are no blank spaces left on the map anymore. If you grew up in the 18th century, there were still new places to go. After hearing tales of foreign adventure, you could become an explorer yourself. This was probably true up through the 19th and early 20th centuries; after that point photography from <span class="italic">National Geographic</span> showed every Westerner what even the most exotic, underexplored places on earth look like. Today, explorers are found mostly in history books and children’s tales. Parents don’t expect their kids to become explorers any more than they expect them to become pirates or sultans. Perhaps there are a few dozen uncontacted tribes somewhere deep in the Amazon, and we know there remains one last earthly frontier in the depths of the oceans. But the unknown seems less accessible than ever.</p>
<p class="indent">Along with the natural fact that physical frontiers have receded, four social trends have conspired to root out belief in secrets. First is <a class="hlink" id="ind346a"></a>incrementalism. From an early age, we are taught that the right way to do things is to proceed one very small step at a time, day by day, grade by grade. If you overachieve and end up learning something that’s not on the test, you won’t receive credit for it. But in exchange for doing exactly what’s asked of you (and for doing it just a bit better than your peers), you’ll get an A. This process extends all the <a id="page98"></a>way up through the tenure track, which is why academics usually chase large numbers of trivial publications instead of new frontiers.</p>
<p class="indent">Second is <a class="hlink" id="ind640a"></a>risk aversion. People are scared of secrets because they are scared of being wrong. By definition, a secret hasn’t been vetted by the mainstream. If your goal is to never make a mistake in your life, you shouldn’t look for secrets. The prospect of being lonely but right—dedicating your life to something that no one else believes in—is already hard. The prospect of being lonely and <span class="italic">wrong</span> can be unbearable.</p>
<p class="indent">Third is <a class="hlink" id="ind121a"></a>complacency. Social elites have the most freedom and ability to explore new thinking, but they seem to believe in secrets the least. Why search for a new secret if you can comfortably collect rents on everything that has already been done? Every fall, the deans at top law schools and business schools welcome the incoming class with the same implicit message: “You got into this elite institution. Your worries are over. You’re set for life.” But that’s probably the kind of thing that’s true only if you don’t believe it.</p>
<p class="indent">Fourth is “<a class="hlink" id="ind246a"></a>flatness.” As <a class="hlink" id="ind294a"></a>globalization advances, people perceive the world as one homogeneous, highly competitive marketplace: the world is “flat.” Given that assumption, anyone who might have had the ambition to look for a secret will first ask himself: if it were possible to discover something new, wouldn’t someone from the faceless global talent pool of smarter and more creative people have found it already? This voice of doubt can dissuade people from even starting to look for secrets in a world that seems too big a place for any individual to contribute something unique.</p>
<p class="indent">There’s an optimistic way to describe the result of these <a id="page99"></a>trends: today, you can’t start a cult. Forty years ago, people were more open to the idea that not all knowledge was widely known. From the Communist Party to the Hare Krishnas, large numbers of people thought they could join some enlightened vanguard that would show them the Way. Very few people take unorthodox ideas seriously today, and the mainstream sees that as a sign of progress. We can be glad that there are fewer crazy <a class="hlink" id="ind144a"></a>cults now, yet that gain has come at great cost: we have given up our sense of wonder at secrets left to be discovered.</p>
<h2 class="a_head">THE WORLD ACCORDING TO <a class="hlink" id="ind141a"></a>CONVENTION</h2>
<p class="nonindent">How must you see the world if you don’t believe in secrets? You’d have to believe we’ve already solved all great questions. If today’s conventions are correct, we can afford to be smug and complacent: “God’s in His heaven, All’s right with the world.”</p>
<p class="indent">For example, a world without secrets would enjoy a perfect understanding of <a class="hlink" id="ind399a"></a>justice. Every injustice necessarily involves a moral truth that very few people recognize early on: in a democratic society, a wrongful practice persists only when most people don’t perceive it to be unjust. At first, only a small minority of abolitionists knew that slavery was evil; that view has rightly become conventional, but it was still a secret in the early 19th century. To say that there are no secrets left today would mean that we live in a society with no hidden injustices.</p>
<p class="indent">In economics, disbelief in secrets leads to faith in <a class="hlink" id="ind192a"></a>efficient <a id="page100"></a>markets. But the existence of <a class="hlink" id="ind58a"></a><a class="hlink" id="ind244a"></a>financial bubbles shows that markets can have extraordinary inefficiencies. (And the more people believe in efficiency, the bigger the bubbles get.) In 1999, nobody wanted to believe that the <a class="hlink" id="ind370a"></a>internet was irrationally overvalued. The same was true of <a class="hlink" id="ind335a"></a>housing in 2005: Fed chairman <a class="hlink" id="ind319a"></a>Alan Greenspan had to acknowledge some “signs of froth in local markets” but stated that “a bubble in home prices for the nation as a whole does not appear likely.” The market reflected all knowable information and couldn’t be questioned. Then home prices fell across the country, and the financial crisis of 2008 wiped out trillions. The future turned out to hold many secrets that economists could not make vanish simply by ignoring them.</p>
<p class="indent">What happens when a company stops believing in secrets? The sad decline of <a class="hlink" id="ind328a"></a>Hewlett-Packard provides a cautionary tale. In 1990, the company was worth $9 billion. Then came a decade of invention. In 1991, HP released the <a class="hlink" id="ind160a"></a>DeskJet 500C, the world’s first affordable color printer. In 1993, it launched the <a class="hlink" id="ind518a"></a>OmniBook, one of the first “superportable” laptops. The next year, HP released the <a class="hlink" id="ind517a"></a>OfficeJet, the world’s first all-in-one printer/fax/copier. This relentless product expansion paid off: by mid-2000, HP was worth $135 billion.</p>
<p class="indent">But starting in late 1999, when HP introduced a new branding campaign around the imperative to “invent,” it stopped inventing things. In 2001, the company launched <a class="hlink" id="ind337a"></a>HP Services, a glorified consulting and support shop. In 2002, HP merged with <a class="hlink" id="ind107a"></a>Compaq, presumably because it didn’t know what else to do. By 2005, the company’s market cap had plunged to $70 billion—roughly half of what it had been just five years earlier.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page101"></a>HP’s board was a microcosm of the dysfunction: it split into two factions, only one of which cared about new technology. That faction was led by <a class="hlink" id="ind573a"></a>Tom Perkins, an engineer who first came to HP in 1963 to run the company’s research division at the personal request of <a class="hlink" id="ind327a"></a>Bill Hewlett and <a class="hlink" id="ind523a"></a>Dave Packard. At 73 years old in 2005, Perkins may as well have been a time-traveling visitor from a bygone age of optimism: he thought the board should identify the most promising new technologies and then have HP build them. But Perkins’s faction lost out to its rival, led by chairwoman <a class="hlink" id="ind178a"></a>Patricia Dunn. A banker by trade, Dunn argued that charting a plan for future technology was beyond the board’s competence. She thought the board should restrict itself to a night watchman’s role: Was everything proper in the accounting department? Were people following all the rules?</p>
<p class="indent">Amid this infighting, someone on the board started leaking information to the press. When it was exposed that Dunn arranged a series of illegal wiretaps to identify the source, the backlash was worse than the original dissension, and the board was disgraced. Having abandoned the search for technological secrets, HP obsessed over gossip. As a result, by late 2012 HP was worth just $23 billion—not much more than it was worth in 1990, adjusting for inflation.</p>
<h2 class="a_head">THE <a class="hlink" id="ind668a"></a>CASE FOR SECRETS</h2>
<p class="nonindent">You can’t find secrets without looking for them. <a class="hlink" id="ind806a"></a>Andrew Wiles demonstrated this when he proved <a class="hlink" id="ind241a"></a>Fermat’s Last Theorem after 358 years of fruitless inquiry by other mathematicians—the kind of sustained failure that might have suggested an <a id="page102"></a>inherently impossible task. <a class="hlink" id="ind240a"></a>Pierre de Fermat had conjectured in 1637 that no integers <span class="italic">a,</span> <span class="italic">b,</span> and <span class="italic">c</span> could satisfy the equation <span class="italic">a</span><span class="italic"><sup class="frac">n</sup></span> + <span class="italic">b</span><span class="italic"><sup class="frac">n</sup></span> = <span class="italic">c</span><span class="italic"><sup class="frac">n</sup></span> for any integer <span class="italic">n</span> greater than 2. He claimed to have a proof, but he died without writing it down, so his conjecture long remained a major unsolved problem in mathematics. Wiles started working on it in 1986, but he kept it a secret until 1993, when he knew he was nearing a solution. After nine years of hard work, Wiles proved the conjecture in 1995. He needed brilliance to succeed, but he also needed a faith in secrets. If you think something hard is impossible, you’ll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief in secrets is an effective truth.</p>
<p class="indent">The actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless searchers. There is more to do in science, medicine, engineering, and in technology of all kinds. We are within reach not just of marginal goals set at the competitive edge of today’s conventional disciplines, but of ambitions so great that even the boldest minds of the Scientific Revolution hesitated to announce them directly. We could cure cancer, dementia, and all the diseases of age and metabolic decay. We can find new ways to generate energy that free the world from conflict over fossil fuels. We can invent faster ways to travel from place to place over the surface of the planet; we can even learn how to escape it entirely and settle new frontiers. But we will never learn any of these secrets unless we demand to know them and force ourselves to look.</p>
<p class="indent">The same is true of business. Great companies can be built on open but unsuspected secrets about how the world works. Consider the Silicon Valley startups that have harnessed the <a id="page103"></a>spare capacity that is all around us but often ignored. Before <a class="hlink" id="ind8a"></a>Airbnb, travelers had little choice but to pay high prices for a hotel room, and property owners couldn’t easily and reliably rent out their unoccupied space. Airbnb saw untapped supply and unaddressed demand where others saw nothing at all. The same is true of private car services <a class="hlink" id="ind433a"></a>Lyft and <a class="hlink" id="ind787a"></a>Uber. Few people imagined that it was possible to build a billion-dollar business by simply connecting people who want to go places with people willing to drive them there. We already had state-licensed taxicabs and private limousines; only by believing in and looking for secrets could you see beyond the convention to an opportunity hidden in plain sight. The same reason that so many internet companies, including Facebook, are often underestimated—their very simplicity—is itself an argument for secrets. If insights that look so elementary in retrospect can support important and valuable businesses, there must remain many great companies still to start.</p>
<h2 class="a_head">HOW TO <a class="hlink" id="ind669a"></a>FIND SECRETS</h2>
<p class="nonindent">There are two kinds of secrets: secrets of nature and secrets <a class="hlink" id="ind667a"></a>about people. <a class="hlink" id="ind497a"></a>Natural secrets exist all around us; to find them, one must study some undiscovered aspect of the physical world. Secrets about people are different: they are things that people don’t know about themselves or things they hide because they don’t want others to know. So when thinking about what kind of company to build, there are two distinct questions to ask: What secrets is nature not telling you? What secrets are people not telling you?</p>
<p class="indent">It’s easy to assume that natural secrets are the most <a id="page104"></a>important: the people who look for them can sound intimidatingly authoritative. This is why physics PhDs are notoriously difficult to work with—because they know the most fundamental truths, they think they know <span class="italic">all</span> truths. But does understanding electromagnetic theory automatically make you a great marriage counselor? Does a gravity theorist know more about your business than you do? At <a class="hlink" id="ind550a"></a>PayPal, I once interviewed a physics PhD for an engineering job. Halfway through my first question, he shouted, “Stop! I already know what you’re going to ask!” But he was wrong. It was the easiest no-hire decision I’ve ever made.</p>
<p class="indent">Secrets about people are relatively underappreciated. Maybe that’s because you don’t need a dozen years of higher education to ask the questions that uncover them: What are people not allowed to talk about? What is forbidden or taboo?</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes looking for natural secrets and looking for human secrets lead to the same truth. Consider the <a class="hlink" id="ind469a"></a>monopoly secret again: <span class="italic">competition <a class="hlink" id="ind114a"></a>and <a class="hlink" id="ind72a"></a>capitalism are opposites</span>. If you didn’t already know it, you could discover it the natural, empirical way: do a quantitative study of corporate profits and you’ll see they’re eliminated by competition. But you could also take the human approach and ask: what are people running companies not allowed to say? You would notice that monopolists downplay their monopoly status to avoid scrutiny, while competitive firms strategically exaggerate their uniqueness. The differences between firms only seem small on the surface; in fact, they are enormous.</p>
<p class="indent">The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking. Most people think only in terms of what they’ve been taught; schooling itself aims to impart conventional <a id="page105"></a>wisdom. So you might ask: are there any fields that matter but haven’t been standardized and institutionalized? <a class="hlink" id="ind586a"></a>Physics, for example, is a real major at all major universities, and it’s set in its ways. The opposite of physics might be astrology, but astrology doesn’t matter. What about something like <a class="hlink" id="ind514a"></a>nutrition? Nutrition matters for everybody, but you can’t major in it at Harvard. Most top scientists go into other fields. Most of the big studies were done 30 or 40 years ago, and most are seriously flawed. The food pyramid that told us to eat low fat and enormous amounts of grains was probably more a product of lobbying by Big Food than real science; its chief impact has been to aggravate our obesity epidemic. There’s plenty more to learn: we know more about the physics of faraway stars than we know about human nutrition. It won’t be easy, but it’s not obviously impossible: exactly the kind of field that could yield secrets.</p>
<h2 class="a_head">WHAT TO DO WITH SECRETS</h2>
<p class="nonindent">If you find a secret, you face a choice: Do you tell anyone? Or do you keep it to yourself?</p>
<p class="indent">It depends on the secret: some are more dangerous than others. As <a class="hlink" id="ind236a"></a>Faust tells <a class="hlink" id="ind799a"></a>Wagner:</p>
<div class="bl_hanging">
<p class="hanging1"><span class="italic">The few who knew what might be learned,</span></p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="italic">Foolish enough to put their whole heart on show,</span></p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="italic">And reveal their feelings to the crowd below,</span></p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="italic">Mankind has always crucified and burned.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Unless you have perfectly conventional beliefs, it’s rarely a good idea to tell everybody everything that you know.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page106"></a>So who do you tell? Whoever you need to, and no more. In practice, there’s always a golden mean between telling nobody and telling everybody—and that’s a company. The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a secret that’s hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator.</p>
<p class="indent">As <a class="hlink" id="ind779a"></a>Tolkien wrote in <span class="italic"><a class="hlink" id="ind427a"></a>The Lord of the Rings</span>:</p>
<div class="bl_hanging">
<p class="hanging1"><span class="italic">The Road goes ever on and on</span></p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="italic">Down from the door where it began.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Life is a long journey; the road marked out by the steps of previous travelers has no end in sight. But later on in the tale, another verse appears:</p>
<div class="bl_hanging">
<p class="hanging1"><span class="italic">Still round the corner there may wait</span></p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="italic">A new road or a secret gate,</span></p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="italic">And though we pass them by today,</span></p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="italic">Tomorrow we may come this way</span></p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="italic">And take the hidden paths that run</span></p>
<p class="hanging1"><span class="italic">Towards the Moon or to the Sun.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The road doesn’t have to be infinite after all. Take the hidden paths.</p>
